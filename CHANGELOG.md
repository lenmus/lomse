# Lomse Library. Log of changes


[Since last version] 0.28.0
=============================

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.27.0

- None.

##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

- None.



Version [0.28.0] (11/Jan/2021)
==============================

#### Features

- Three new Views have been implemented: `HalfPage`, `FreeFlow` and `SinglePage` Views.
- Transposing instruments are now correctly taken into account for playback.
- Auto-scaling has been implemented. Now, when the paper height is too small to render just one system, instead of rendering an error message, the scale is automatically adjusted so that the score can fit on the available space.
- Pitch computation when clefs with octave numbers has been fixed.
- The quality of scores renderization has been greatly improved in several areas: full support for grace notes, layout of slurs, beams, correct engraving of wedges and volta-brackets when at start and end of system, intermediate shapes in volta-brackets, octave shifts, slur, and other spanners are now rendered, clef change is now correctly  laid out, and some other minor fixes.


#### MusicXML support

- Compressed MusicXML files are now supported (thanks, Dmitri Ovodok).
- MusicXML importer now processes `<transpose>` elements and this information is now taken into account for playback
- Cue notes are now imported, although for now they are displayed as normal notes.
- Clefs 'TAB' and 'none' are now supported
- MusicXML importer now properly deals with `<clef-octave-change>`


#### Technical changes

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.27.0

- `RenderingBuffer` is no longer an object that the user app. should know about. Therefore, methods `Interactor::set_rendering_buffer()` and `Interactor::set_print_buffer()` accepting a ptr. to the `RenderingBuffer` have been deprecated and replaced by two new methods that receive the necessary data `(unsigned char* buf, unsigned width, unsigned height)`. Deprecated methods can still be used but will be removed in the future. Please update your code.

##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

- A new method `Interactor::set_view_area()` has been defined. Its usage is optional and it is oriented to define a sub-region of the rendering bitmap.
- Transposition is now fully supported in the internal model and playback
- The logger output destination is now customizable.
- The definition and creation of a proper user API for accessing and managing the internal model has been started and the root elements have been defined.
- A debug option for coloring the relevant chord notes has been added.
- Scores, scripts and instructions for visual regression tests have been added, so that any one can now run the regression tests.




Version [0.27.0] (14/Apr/2020)
==============================

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.26.0

None, but behaviour has changed and could impact:
- Font management and substitutions: Lomse now uses system installed fonts in
  Linux and Windows. For Windows,
  Bravura music font is still required in the path specified in configuration
  macro LOMSE_FONTS_PATH. For other platforms, the old approach (fonts
  provided by user application) is applied.


##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

More music notation supported:
    - Added octave-shift lines.
    - Added crescendo/diminuendo wedges (hairpins). 
    - The MusicXML importer now also imports these notations.

Improvements in music layout:
    - Full-measure rests are now centered in the measure.
    - The space between systems and staves is now dynamically increased to
      avoid collisions between notation symbols.
	- A `VerticalProfile` object tracks ocupied space and provides the infrastructure
	  for avoiding vertical collisions.
	- The order for engraving auxiliary notation symbols has been changed. Until now,
	  once a note was engraved, all its additional attached notation symbols were also
	  engraved. From now, all aditional notation symbols in a system are engraved by type
	  for all the system, following a predefined order (defined, in general, by music
	  engraving rules). For example, first all beams for a system are engraved, then all
	  the articulations for all the notes in the system, etc.
	- Engravers now have access to the vertical space occupied by already engraved symbols
	  and, therefore, can take decisions to avoid collisions between the symbols.
	- Some engravers have been modified to use the new facilities and engrave the symbols
	  without collisions.
    - Slurs layout has been slightly improved.

Other changes:
    - The log file is now created at user home folder.
    - The height for single system view is now computed by adding top and bottom paper margins
      to the real height of the system, once it is layouted. Previously, the height was fixed
      and was defined by paper height.
    - Added methods in `Interactor` to add/remove visual application markings. Created the
      first application markings class: `FragmentMark`. This class allows to display on any
      score brackets and vertical lines, spanning one or several staves, to define the start
      and end points of a score section or fragment.
    - Fix bug in anacrusis time computation.
    - Other bug fixes.


Version [0.26.0] (29/Dec/2018)
=============================

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.25.0

- Pitch representation in Lomse internal model was not the best representation for
  supporting transposition or other pitch changes. So, it was necessary to review and
  change all this in the internal model. This change should not create backwards 
  incompatibilities in user applications, but it is an important change.

- External methods related to key signatures have been packaged as static methods in
  a new class KeyUtilities. Probably, current applications using Lomse never used
  these methods, so this change should not create backwards incompatibilities.

##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

- Added new edition commands for transposition.
- Added class FIntval for managing intervals.
- MusicXML importer now accepts metronome directions.
- The algorithm for auto-scroll has been improved.
- During playback, when the time signature changes, metronome clicks
  interval is now adjusted for maintaining notes duration equivalence.
- Added new methods for controlling scroll and visual tracking during
  playback, when using an external player. A new sample 'extplayer' has
  been added to the 'examples' folder.
- Added Interactor method to customize visual tracking effects
- Added Interactor method to define what is a beat. This allows, for
  example, to subdivide metronome or to decide which note duration
  corresponds to a metronome click. It is also useful for methods that
  specify a location by using measure/beat parameters.
- The internal model now has information about measure attributes, such
  as the displayed measure number. All importers now parse and
  store this information.
- Measure numbers can now be rendered. Options for controlling measures
  numbering have been added. MusicXML importer modified for importing
  measure numbering options.
- Style "Measure numbers" has been added to the scores for controlling
  the appearance of measure numbers.
- Defined a new barline type: alternative rendering for double repetition,
  using two thick barlines instead of thin barlines (E.Gould, p.234)
- Fixes for removing Microsoft compiler warnings.
- Fixes for all high impact outstanding defects detected with coverity scan.
- Fixes for a few bugs causing a crash in specific scenarios:
    - Visual tracking effects now cleared after deleting the graphic model.
    - The sound thread is now not deleted when it has finished.
    - Crash caused by visual tracking when the score is embedded in a
	  text, at the end of a document page, but the score is laid out in
	  the next document page.
- Fixes for a few bugs related to scores layout:
    - Fixed bug preventing to modify spacing value parameter from score
	  option "Render.SpacingValue". Also it was incorrectly treated as
	  float in ScoreMeter and in LDP parser.
    - Fixed bugs related to Gourlay's lines justification and value for Dmin
	  parameter.
    - Spacing when there are invisible shapes (e.g. spacers) where
	  incorrectly computed
    - A clef change after prolog was not engraved in smaller size because
	  it was considered part of the prolog.
- Fixed some bugs related to visual tracking effects:
    - Color for highlight notes visual tracking was not initialized.
    - Bug in tempo line positioning preventing to move the line to the correct page.
    - Incorrect positioning visual tracking tempo line when anacrusis start.
- Other changes:
    - Removed unused method `Interactor::move_tempo_line_to(ImoStaffobj* pSO)`.
    - Incorrect computation of beat type (strong, weak, off-beat), that
	  affected to the computation of note volume, for stressing strong beats.
	  It also affected Lomse user applications that could be using this method, such
      as LenMus Phonascus.
    - Spacing algorithm has been refactored to facilitate maintenance. All
	  spacing methods have been reviewed and more tests added. All test
	  has been documented as well as the reasons for the different rules.
	  Fixes in a couple of spacing rules.



Version [0.25.0] (29/Jun/2018)
=============================

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.24.0

* Until now all visual tracking effects were named score highlight effects
  due to the fact that highlighting notes/rests was the first programmed
  visual effect. But, currently, Lomse supports more visual tracking
  effects and, for coherence and to use more descriptive names, all
  references to score highlight effects have been changed, when appropriate,
  to 'visual tracking' effects. In particular, the more important changes
  that will affect your code are:
	- Class `EventScoreHighlight` changed to `EventVisualTracking`.
	- Type `SpEventcoreHighlight` changed to `SpEventVisualTracking`.
	- Enum item `k_highlight_event` changed to `k_tracking_event`.
	- Method `Interactor::on_visual_highlight` changed to `Interactor::on_visual_tracking`.
	- Enum item `k_end_of_higlight` changed to `k_end_of_visual_tracking`.
	- Enum item `k_advance_tempo_line` changed to `k_move_tempo_line`.
	- Enum item `k_highlight_event` changed to `k_tracking_event`.


##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

* Added method `Interactor::set_visual_tracking_mode(int mode)` for
  selecting the visual trackin effect to use. A new enum `EVisualTrackingMode`
  defines valid modes.
* Changes to allow extension '.musicxml' for uncompressed MusicXML files.
* Added some initial code to deal with `global` elements in experimental
  MNX importer.
* Changes to allow compilers other than GCC and MSVC.
* Several fixes to make Lomse buildable in macOS with clang compiler.
* Several changes for trying to reduce or eliminate dependencies from
  other libraries. In particular:
	- PR #144 Replaced boost::format with standard functions
	- PR #146 Replaced boost::variant with union class



Version [0.24.0] (4/Mar/2018)
=============================

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.23.0

Removed enum in ViewFactory. All values 'ViewFactory::k_view_xxxxx' must
be replaced by just 'k_view_xxxxx'.


##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

	* Added a new View (SingeSystemView) to display scores as a single
	  system.
	* Added method Interactor::set_view_background() for customizing
	  the background color in all views.



Version [0.23.0] (24/Feb/2018)
==============================

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.22.0

- While documenting class Document and starting to document the internal
  model, some methods were renamed to use more meaningfull names:
	- `Document::removed_from_model()` renamed to `Document::on_removed_from_model()`.
	- `Document::get_imodoc()` renamed to `Document::get_im_root()`.
	- `ImoScore::close()` renamed to `ImoScore::end_of_changes()`.

- InternalModel class was removed. It was useless as it was just a wrapper
  class without additional functionality.


##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

- Make Document a facade for accessing some ImoDocument frequently used
  methods.

- Added more code to the MNX importer, for testing current
  specification draft.

- Created an MNX exporter, also for testing current specification draft
and to prepare Lomse for fully supporting the MNX specification.



Version [0.22.0] (9/Jan/2018)
=============================

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.21.0

While documenting Lomse events some issues where found (see issue #111)
and it was decided to refactor some events. Unfortunatelly most of these
changes create incompatibilities due to renames. In particular:

- Some useless event classification methods in EventInfo have been removed.

- EventPlayScore has been renamed:
	- EventPlayScore of types k_do_play_score_event, k_pause_score_event and
      k_stop_playback_event renamed as EventPlayCtrl.
    - EventPlayScore of type k_end_of_playback_event renamed as EventEndOfPlayback

- Removed event types k_highlight_on_event, k_highlight_off_event,
  k_end_of_higlight_event and k_advance_tempo_line_event, and replaced by
  an enum in EventScoreHighlight. 

- Event EventMouse (type k_show_contextual_menu_event) renamed as
  EventContextualMenu (type k_show_contextual_menu_event)

- Created EventMouse, type k_link_clicked_event. It replaces on_click
  events on ImoLink because the way in which they are sent to the user
  application is different and, therefore, it is confusing how to handle
  them. The new event type is also more specific.

- Removed EventView and created bases classes EventAction and EventPlayback

- Method Interactor::send_end_of_play_event()" renamed as 
  "on_end_of_play_event()" to avoid raising questions on users about 
  the contradiction of having to ask the Interactor to
  "send_end_of_play_event" when an end of play event has been received
  and is being processed.


##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

- Playback improvements: playback now takes into account repetitions 
  implied by barlines with repetition dots and volta brackets, as well
  as repetions implied by textual repetition marks (i.e. Da Capo, 
  To Coda, etc, ...) (issue #79).

- Auto-scroll during playback (issue #88): When playing back an score
  it is necessary to ensure that current played notes are visible. 
  Therefore, as the playback advances, the score should auto-scroll to
  maintaint the viewport on the notes being played back. The implemented
  solution defines a new Lomse event, *EventUpdateViewport*, that
  informs about the need to change the viewport and provides the
  coordinates for the new viewport origin. It is up to the user
  application to do it or not.

- Technical changes:
	- As c++11 and std::regex support is required, CMakeLists.txt has
	  been updated:
		- cmake required version is now 2.8.10 or greater, and
		- gcc required version is now 4.9 or greater.
	- Added initial code for start experimentation with MNX format.

- Bugs fixed:
	- #98. Tempo speed setting problem using PlayerGui object.
	- #96. Score deletion crash due to double inclusion in RelObjs.


Version [0.21.0] (9/Nov/2017)
=============================

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.20.0

- Building Lomse now requires to use c++11 or greater.

##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

- Many changes for improving support for MusicXML:
	- Import and render volta brackets.
	- Import and render 'words'. Detect strings implying repetition
  	  marks (i.e. "To Coda", "D.C.", ...)
	- Fix beams in malformed MusicXML files (issue #67).
	- Assume some default value for clef in MusicXML importer (issue #68)
	- Added options for controlling behaviour of MusicXML importer when
  	  uncomplete or malformed MusicXML files.
	- MusicXML importer now deals with all midi information in score-part
      (MusicXML 3.0) and is added to the internal model (issue #82).
	- Fixed error in the MusicXML importer: the pitch for notes with
  	  accidentals was computed wrong (issue #77).
- Improvements in tuplets renderization and support:
    - Nested tuplets now fully supported.
    - MusicXML importer now imports tuplets.
    - Nested tuplets now fully supported in LDP.
    - Layout of tuplets improved and also nested tuplets are now drawn.
- Improvements in layout:
	- Systems justification changed for using approximate sff.
	- Line breaker algorithm improved. Now it considers different break
	  modes.
	- Fixed spacing issues, related to clefs and prolog objects, detected 
  	  in regression tests.
	- Fixed an issue with justification, detected in regression tests. It
  	  caused that in some cases the system was not justified.
- LDP related changes:
	- Blank space in LDP exporter has been normalized.
	- LDP exporter reviewed for following the same syntax rules than 
  	  LDP Analyser, thus ensuring a round trip in LDP export-import.
	- Some small fixes in LDP exporter.
- Fixed issue #81. Instead of assigning MIDI channel 0 to any instrument
  without MIDI settings, now a different channel is assigned to each
  instrument.
- Fixed issue #69: Playback very slow for 3/8 tempo
- Fixed issue #73: Highlight is not synced. when moving to next page.
- Fixed issue #70: Score highlight does not work in some scores.
- Fixed issue #10: Note flags too long for short stems.
- Fixed issue #99: small issue that can cause a crash.
- Implemented method SimpleView::get_view_size() that was empty!


Version [0.20.0] (1/Sep/2016)
=============================

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.19.0

- LibraryScope methods 'set_draw_anchors()' and 'draw_anchors()'
  have been renamed as 'set_draw_anchor_objects()' and 
  'draw_anchor_objects()', respectively.

##### COMPATIBLE CHANGES

- The spacing algorithm has been replaced. Previous algorithm was scattered
  along several objects and was difficult to understand and, therefore, to 
  modify and to improve. It was first isolated in a single object with a 
  clear interface, and an abstract class was defined to facilitate 
  replacement and experimentation with different algorithms in future. Then 
  a new algorithm, based on Gourlay's approach, was implemented. The new 
  algorithm is easier to understand and gives more flexibility.

- The lines break algorithm was still valid, but the penalty function has 
  been changed. This improves layout and gives more control and flexibility. 

- Lyrics are now taken into account for spacing notes, removing the lyrics
  layout problems that were present in previous version. The internal model
  for lyrics has been replaced by a new model, to allow for better control
  of the layout process.
  Also additional space between staves is added when lyrics are present.
  The solution for vertical staves spacing is provisional and requires more
  changes (in study). Nevertheless, in preparation for these changes, the
  score layout algorithm have been modified for dealing with systems 
  with variable height.

- Trace and debug options has been added to the library, to facilitate
  experimentation and debugging of spacing algorithm and lines breaker 
  algorithm.

- Although in finished scores is normal practice to justify the last system,
  there are cases were this is not required or even need to be prevented. 
  Also, truncation of staff lines after last object is a need in some 
  cases. Therefore, scenarios for justification and truncation of last 
  system have been analyzed, and specific options for controlling the 
  behaviour have been added to the library. Now users can fully control 
  these aspects. LDP options for this have been reviewed and adapted. 
  As a consequence, two existing options ('Score.JustifyFinalBarline' 
  and 'StaffLines.StopAtFinalBarline') have been deprecated and replaced
  by two new options ('Score.JustifyLastSystem' and 'StaffLines.Truncate').

- For backwards compatibility to prevent undesired changes in existing 
  scores due to the new algorithms (that is, for ensuring that the visual 
  appearance of existing LDP scores, mainly for LenMus eBooks, is preserved), 
  the spacing algorithm parameters have been adjusted. New LDP options 
  ('Render.SpacingOptions' and "Render.SpacingFopt") has been added for 
  controlling the behaviour of the new spacing algorithm and the lines 
  breaker algorithm, so that users can have now full control of spacing 
  and lines breaking algorithm options.

- Renderization is improved in several aspects:
    - Score titles are now rendered.
    - Additional syllables and elision symbols in lyrics are now rendered.
    - Added more symbols for fermata.
    - Names and brackets/braces for groups of instruments now rendered.
    - Barlines for groups now can be joined. Also mensurstrich layout is
      supported.
    - Left barline at start of systems now also drawn in empty scores.

- Added support, in LDP, for many music notations: lyrics, articulations
  (accents & stress marks), dynamics marks, groups of instruments and
  score titles.

- Also several fixes and small changes:
    - Fixes for avoiding compilation errors with c++11 compilers.
    - Whitespace in text now properly managed in LMD files (issue #42).
    - Default styles added to headings, paragraphs and tables (issue #43).
    - New system tag now works again (issue #1).
    - MusicXML importer now supports part groups.
    - Added squared bracket for part groups (group symbol == line)

Version [0.15.0] (27/Mar/2015)
============================

Development continues. Mainly changes for supporting document edition. A few backwards
incompatible changes, that will require a couple of fixes in existing code using this
library. 
	

##### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 0.14.0

- enum EBarlines created.
&rarr; Backwards compatibility: You have to replace all barline constants, 
  such as "ImoBarline::k_simple" by "k_barline_simple", etc
- The update screen policy has been reviewed and clarified. As a consequence some
changes has been made affecting, mainly, to Interactor class. 
&rarr; Backwards compatibility: Interactor::new_viewport() and all Interactor
  methods for changing scale and zooming factor, now force a redraw. A third
  parameter (bool fForceRedraw=true) has been added to these methods. You can 
  modify your existing code by specifying fForceRedraw=false for preventing
  redraws and keep the old behaviour
- File format parameter added to LomseDorway::new_document() and 
PresenterBuilder::new_document() for choosing source code format.
&rarr; Backwards compatibility: You will have to review your code and add 
  this parameter with value 'Document::k_format_ldp' as that was the
  expected format in previous versions.
