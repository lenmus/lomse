/** %ApplicationMark is the base class for all application markings objects.

    Application markings are just temporary visual markers created by an application
    to provide feedback to the user about relevant issues, such as start-end points
    for playback, the set of objects selected, current notes being played, etc.

    Lomse does not use these marks and knows nothing about its purpose or meaning. Lomse
    just displays them.

    @attention  Application markings are just visual effects and are not stored in the
        Document object. They must be deleted when the document is modified and
        re-created if they are still needed. This is a very simple operation and is
        required because when the document is modified nothing ensures that existing
        markers are still valid. Pointed objects could no longer exist in the document
        or the positions at which the markers were initially placed are no longer the
        right places in the updated document rendering.

/** %FragmentMark is an ApplicationMark to display on any score brackets and vertical
    lines, spanning one or several staves, to define the start and end points of
    a score section or fragment.

    FragmentMark objects are created by the Interactor associated to the View on which
    the mark is going to be displayed.

	See:
	- @ref Interactor::add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(),
	- @ref Interactor::add_fragment_mark_at_barline(),
	- @ref Interactor::add_fragment_mark_at_staffobj().

	The following picture displays the different types of %FragmentMark markers that can
	be created. The markers were created with the code shown at the end of this
	description.

    @image html FragmentMark-types.png "Image: Different types of FragmentMark markers."



    <h3>Marks' horizontal position</h3>

    Marks of type `k_mark_line` are positioned centered on the reference timepos
    vertical line.

    For all other types:
    - When created using method Interactor::add_fragment_mark_at_barline() the marks are
        also positioned centered on the reference timepos vertical line, that is the
        barline left border.
    - When created by any other Interactor methods:
        - Type `open` are displayed with the inner bracket vertical border aligned with
            the timepos vertical line.
        - Type `close` are displayed with the outside bracket vertical border aligned
            with the timepos vertical line.

    It is possible to add an horizontal shift to the mark default position.
    See x_shift(). The horizontal shift can be modified when necessary.

    But marks cannot be repositioned, that is, its reference timepos can not be changed.
    If this is needed, just delete current mark (by invoking Interactor::remove_mark() )
    and create a new one at the new desired position.


    <h3>Marks' vertical position and height</h3>

    By default, the mark will cover the whole staff from top line of first staff to
    bottom line of bottom staff, plus an additional height of the spacing between
    systems (half is added on top and half on bottom). This additional height to add
    can be chaged by method extra_height().

    Methods top() and bottom() allows to define the vertical position and height of
    the mark by defining the reference instruments and staves that will be covered
    by the mark. When using any of these methods, the additional height will be changed
    to be the staves margin. You can later change this value by using method
    extra_height().

    The height and vertical position of the mark can be changed at any moment.
    See top(), bottom() and extra_height() methods.


    <h3>Example of use:</h3>

    The marks in previous image were created with this code:

    @code
    ImoId scoreId = pScore->get_id();

    //green mark: open rounded at staffobj (key signature).
    //From second instrument to last one
    ScoreCursor cursor(pDoc, pScore);     //cursor points to clef
    cursor.move_next();         //now points to key signature
    ImoStaffObj* pSO = dynamic_cast<ImoStaffObj*>(*(cursor));
    FragmentMark* mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_staffobj(pSO);
    mark->color(Color(0,255,0))->top(1);
    mark->type(k_mark_open_rounded);

    cursor.move_next();         //now points to time signature
    pSO = dynamic_cast<ImoStaffObj*>(*(cursor));
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_staffobj(pSO);
    mark->color(Color(0,255,0))->top(1);
    mark->type(k_mark_close_rounded);

    //blue curly marks: at first barline (measure 1, beat 0) and second
    //barline  (measure 2, beat 0). The whole system
    TimeUnits timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 1, 0);
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_barline(scoreId, timepos);
    mark->color(Color(0,0,255,128))->type(k_mark_open_curly);

    timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 2, 0);
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_barline(scoreId, timepos);
    mark->color(Color(0,0,255,128))->type(k_mark_close_curly);

    //red line mark: first note after first barline (measure 1, beat 0)
    timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 1, 0);
    spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(scoreId, timepos);

    //magenta line mark: at interpolated timepos. Only third instrument
    timepos += k_duration_eighth;    //at first quarter dotted note position
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(scoreId, timepos);
    mark->color(Color(255,0,255,128))->type(k_mark_line)->top(2);

    //solid blue curly mark: instruments 2,3 & 4
    timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 1, 1);
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(scoreId, timepos);
    mark->color(Color(0,0,255))->top(1,0)->bottom(3);
    mark->type(k_mark_open_curly)->x_shift(-5.0);   //some space before

    timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 1, 2);
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(scoreId, timepos);
    mark->color(Color(0,0,255))->top(1,0)->bottom(3);
    mark->type(k_mark_close_curly)->x_shift(25.0);  //some space to skip noteheads

    //magenta squared mark: instruments 2,3 & 4
    timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 2,1);
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(scoreId, timepos);
    mark->color(Color(255,0,255,128))->top(1,0)->bottom(3);
    mark->type(k_mark_open_squared);

    timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 2,2);
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(scoreId, timepos);
    mark->color(Color(255,0,255,128))->top(1,0)->bottom(3);
    mark->type(k_mark_close_squared);

    //green line mark: instruments 2,3 & 4
    timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 3,0);
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(scoreId, timepos);
    mark->color(Color(0, 255,0))->top(1,0)->bottom(3);
    mark->type(k_mark_line);

    //red rounded mark: instruments 2,3 & 4
    timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 4,0);
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(scoreId, timepos);
    mark->color(Color(255,0,0))->top(1,0)->bottom(3);
    mark->type(k_mark_open_rounded);

    timepos = ScoreAlgorithms::get_timepos_for(pScore, 4,1);
    mark = spInteractor->add_fragment_mark_at_note_rest(scoreId, timepos);
