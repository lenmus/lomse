        creating/opening documents and scores, which in turn provides accessors for
        managing the open documents.
    - For the Lomse library, it is the way to access platform dependent information and
        methods, by using callbacks initialized by the user during Lomse configuration.

    //library initialization and configuration
	/** Before using the library, method init_library() **must** be invoked for
        initializing the library and providing the necessary information. As Lomse
        renders scores and documents on a bitmap it is necessary to inform Lomse about
        the required bitmap properties. Also, you can set an ostream to be used by
        Lomse for reporting errors.

        @param pixel_format A value from the global enumeration type #EPixelFormat
        @param ppi The required resolution in pixels per inch (e.g., 72)
        @param reverse_y_axis Lomse needs to know if the presentation device in which
            the bitmaps are going to be rendered follows the standard convention
            used in screen displays in which the y coordinates increases downwards,
            that is, y-axis coordinate 0 is at top of screen and increases downwards
            to bottom of screen. This convention is just the opposite of the normal
            convention for geometry, in which 0 coordinate is at bottom of paper and
            increases upwards. Lomse follows the standard convention used in
            displays (y-axis 0 coordinate at top and increases downwards).
            Therefore, we have to inform Lomse if the y-axis follows the standard
            convention for screens (reverse_y_axis = @false) or, by the contrary,
            Lomse has to reverse the y axis (reverse_y_axis = @true).
        @param reporter The ostream to be used by Lomse for reporting errors. By default,
            all errors will be send to cout.

        For instance, assume we are writing an application for Linux to display scores
        on screen:

        @code
        LomseDoorway m_lomse;                   //the only instance, representing the lomse library
        int pixel_format = k_pix_format_rgb24;  //pixel format: RGB 24bits
        int resolution = 96;                    //96 ppi
        bool reverse_y_axis = false;            //y-axis coordinate 0 is at top of screen and increases downwards

        //initialize the library with these values
        m_lomse.init_library(pixel_format, resolution, reverse_y_axis);
        @endcode
	*/
    void init_library(int pixel_format, int ppi, bool reverse_y_axis,
                      ostream& reporter=cout);

	/** This method is used by for informing Lomse about the callback method that Lomse
        should invoke when having to communicate an event to your application.

        @param pThis    A pointer to the instance of object that will receive the
            notifications.
        @param pt2Func  A pointer to the method in previous object that Lomse will
            invoke when an event is generated in Lomse.

        See @subpage page-callbacks.

        For example, to prepare our application for handling visual tracking events
        during score playback we could define a callback method:

        @code
        class MyApp
        {
        public:
            //callback wrapper
            static void wrapper_for_lomse_event_handler(void* pThis, SpEventInfo pEvent)
            {
                static_cast<MyApp*>(pThis)->on_lomse_event(pEvent);
            }
            ...

        protected:
            void on_lomse_event(SpEventInfo pEvent);
            ...
        };
        @endcode

        And inform lomse about it. We do it at lomse initialization:

        @code
        void MyApp::initialize_lomse()
        {
            //initialize the library
            ...
            m_lomse.init_library(pixel_format, resolution, reverse_y_axis);

            //set callbacks
            m_lomse.set_notify_callback(this, wrapper_for_lomse_event_handler);

            ...
        }
        @endcode

	*/

	/** This method is used by for informing Lomse about the callback method that Lomse
        should invoke when having to request information to your application.
        See Request, RequestDynamic, RequestFont

        @param pThis    A pointer to the instance of object that will receive the
            notifications.
        @param pt2Func  A pointer to the method in previous object that Lomse will
            invoke when a requests is generated in Lomse.

        See @subpage page-callbacks
        for an explanation of Lomse callbacks and its parameters.

        For example:

        @code
        class MyApp
        {
        public:
            //requests wrapper
            static void wrapper_for_lomse_requests(void* pThis, Request* pRequests)
            {
                static_cast<MyApp*>(pThis)->on_lomse_request(pRequest);
            }
            ...

        protected:
            void on_lomse_request(Request* pRequest);
            ...
        };
        @endcode

        And inform lomse about it. We do it at lomse initialization:

        @code
        void MyApp::initialize_lomse()
        {
            //initialize the library
            ...

            //set callbacks
            m_lomse.set_request_callback(this, wrapper_for_lomse_requests);

            ...

        fonts the user would like to use are located. They are probably in the folder
        used by the operating system for fonts. But as Lomse is platform independent,
        currently it has no knowledge about operating system folders for fonts.
        Therefore, applications using additional fonts other than Lomse default fonts
        should use this method for informing Lomse about the path for the fonts.
