/** %HalfPageView is a GraphicView for rendering scores.

    This view has a double behaviour. In normal mode (no playback) it behaves as
    SinglePageView, that is the score is rendered on a single page as high as necessary
    to contain all the score (e.g., an HTML page having a body of fixed size).

    But when in playback mode, the bitmap to be rendered in the application window is
    split horizontally in two halves, originating two virtual vertical windows, one at
    top and the other at bottom. In the top window it is displayed the first score chunk
    and the second chunk is displayed in the bottom window. When playback enters in the
    bottom window the top window is updated with the third chunk. Next, when the playback
    enters again in the top window, the bottom window is updated with the next chunk,
    and so on.

    When playback is finished (because the end of the score is reached or because the
    app stops playback Â -- but not when playback is paused --) the display returns
    automatically to SinglePageView mode.

    This view allows to solve the problem page turning and the problem of repetition
    marks and jumps:  when the window being played has a jump to a system not visible
    in that window, the other window is updated  with the next logical system (the one
    containing the jump destination) instead of with the next system. The behaviour for
    the user is very simple: when the end of the last system in current window is reached
    or when user finds a jump to a point that is not displayed in current window, he/she
    will know that it is necessary to jump to the other half window.

    You should note that when the view is split, only full systems are displayed in
    the sub-windows. This is to avoid doubts about were the music continues, that could
    appear in cases in which next system is practically fully displayed after current
    one. It also makes the display more clear.

    The view does not enter in split mode in the following cases:
    - when window height is smaller than two times the highest system,
    - when window width is lower than system width,
    - when the score fits completely in the window height, or
    - when the document is not only one score
    In these cases, playback behaviour will be that of SinglePageView

    When the view is in split mode (during playback) all settings for controlling what
    to display and how, are fully controlled by the view. Therefore, the user application
    should disable all user controls that could invoke methods to do changes, such as
    scroll position, zoom factor or other. Invoking these methods will not cause crashes
    but will cause unnecessary interference with what is displayed.
