# Test scores

This folder contains scores created and used for testing Lomse. All the scores in this root folder are used in visual regression tests, and some of them also in unit tests. Apart from them:

* Sub-folder `dev-tests` contains scores used for development or for investigating and fixing a bug, that are not later used neither for unit-tests nor for regression tests.
* Sub-folder `unit-tests` contains additional scores in unit tests.
* Sub-folder `regression` contains the images for visual regression tests.
