<section level="2">Scales</section>
<!-- =================================================================== -->

<para>
If you're learning an instrument you've probably played some
scales already, but you might have learnt to play them without thinking
about the actual notes, (your fingers do the thinking!). But to understand music and learn about harmony you need to know the scales and how they are built.
</para>

<para>
A scale, from latin word 'scala' meaning 'ladder', is a predefined series of notes going up (ascending) or down (descending). People in different musical traditions have different ideas about what notes they think sound best together. In the Western musical tradition - which includes most familiar music from Europe and the Americas - the octave is divided up into twelve equally spaced notes. Other musical traditions - traditional Chinese music for example - have divided the octave differently and so they use different scales.
</para>

<para>
Let's start learning about the 'bricks' for building scales: <emphasis>tones</emphasis> and <emphasis>semitones</emphasis>.
</para>


<section level="2">Semitones</section>
<!-- =================================================================== -->

<para>The minimum distance between two pitches that we will consider in the Western musical tradition is called a <emphasis>semitone</emphasis>, also named <emphasis>half step</emphasis>. Let's use a piano keyboard to look at some examples.</para>

<para role='center'>
<imagedata fileref='keyboard.png' translate='yes' />
</para>

<para>
The first thing to notice is that, as said, we have twelve notes within an octave, represented by seven white keys and five black keys. But only seven letter names are used to name notes: C, D, E, F, G, A and B. The eighth note would, of course, be the next C, beginning the next octave. To name the other notes, the notes on the black piano keys, you have to use a sharp or flat sign. The white keys are the <emphasis>natural notes</emphasis>. Black keys can only be named using sharps or flats.
</para>

<para>If two notes are as close as possible on the piano keyboard (two neighbouring keys, whatever colour, black or white), we call the distance between them a <emphasis>semitone</emphasis>. In the following picture I have coloured pairs of notes whose distance is a semitone.
</para>

<para role='center'>
<imagedata fileref='semitones-keyboard.png' translate='yes' /> <!-- Semitones on the keyboard -->
</para>

<para>Find E and F on the piano keyboard. The distance between E and F is a
semitone; it's not possible to squeeze another note in between them,
because there is nothing between them on the piano keyboard.
</para>

<section level="2">Chromatic scales</section>
<!-- =================================================================== -->

<para>
A chromatic scale has the twelve notes, and each step of the scale is a semitone.
Let's return to the piano keyboard. If you start on a C key
and play every available key, black and white, until you arrive at the next C, you have played a
chromatic scale:

<para>There are no different types of chromatic scales. Either, we don't talk about chromatic scales as being in a particular key; we just talk about the note they start on - and they can start on any note.</para>

<para>
You need to be able to recognise chromatic scales, as well as
sections of a chromatic scale within a piece of music.
To find a section of a chromatic scale, just look for a series of notes that are
all one semitone apart.
